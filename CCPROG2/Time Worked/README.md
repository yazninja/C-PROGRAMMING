# Time worked

**Complete the different tasks in the program.**  

The program should compute for the amount of time worked of an employee. 

> The program has two 1-dimensional arrays. One represents the **time in**, the other represents the **time out** for each day in the month.  

The time is assumed to be valid time, indicated in military format 
> (e.g. 0000 is equivalent to 0 and means 12:00 midnight; 1430 is equivalent to 2:30pm). 

Assume that the time out will not be before the time in. 
The program generates the duration in minutes stored into a third array.   
Contents of the resulting array should be displayed, as well as the computed hours and minutes.  A total amount of time worked in the month is also displayed at the end.

 

Use the program template given. Do **NOT** modify the main program, unless it is to accomplish the required task (i.e., indicate the correct parameter).  You may add additional functions, if you wish, but these should be called within the functions you are supposed to create (as a support for some tasks).

 

*It is suggested that you  use input redirection to facilitate the input process.*

A sample set of inputs is provided here: [sampleTime.txt](https://github.com/yazninja/C-PROGRAMMING/blob/main/CCPROG2/Time%20Worked/sampleTime.txt)
The expected result for that (if you use output redirection) should can be seen in: [expected.txt](https://github.com/yazninja/C-PROGRAMMING/blob/main/CCPROG2/Time%20Worked/expected.txt)
Note that the text, format, and spacing should be exactly the same.
