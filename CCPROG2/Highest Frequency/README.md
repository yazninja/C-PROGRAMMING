# Highest Frequency

Implement the function *getHighestFrequency()*. 
The function takes in two parameters: the base address of an array consisting a set of integers and the number of accessible elements within that array. 
The function returns the most frequently occurring element within the array. 
> In the case of a tie, or multiple values containing the same frequencies, the higher value is returned.

Use the program template given. Do **NOT** modify the main program, unless it is to accomplish the required task (i.e., indicate the correct parameter). Do **NOT** place printf() and scanf() statements in your functions. You may add additional functions, if you wish, but these should be called within the functions you are supposed to create (as a support for some tasks).

*It is suggested that you use input redirection to facilitate the input process.*
